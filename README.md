# Your startup name here

[My Notes](notes.md)

Handwriting Speed Competition Game with global leaderboards.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
> Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

I built a machine learning model that can read what people physically write. Ink is a game that puts you against your friends in handwriting. The model checks for accuracy, and words written the fastest are put on a global leaderboard. Monitization is done by different skins, backgrounds, helpers, pets, and sponsorships. There are also educational applications that provide areas of future expansion. 

### Design

![Design image](260sitemockups.jpg)

The idea is to have the focus completely on the writing, with other pages for leaderboards, navigation, etc.

```

### Key features

- Timed Rounds
- Scoring
- Leaderboards
- Practice mode to choose which words you want
- See other players attempts and scores real time

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - use (header/main) semantics, a canvas for drawing, and forms for login and register
- **CSS** - Responsive layout, clean ui (heavily focused on game page). Small animations like a countdown or feedback
- **React** - Single page app with routes. Comps like drawing pad, timer, results, etc.
- **Service** - Backend for: register page, getting the next word, submitting an attempt and getting a score, getting leaderboard, gotta get the ML prediction. Third party api for getting random words or showing definitions of chosen words or something.
- **DB/Login** - Store Users, hashed passwords, session tokens, attempts, leaderboard stuff. Must be authenticated to submit.
- **WebSocket** - Broadcast when people finish attempts or there is a new record for a word.
